# static-site-sample

This is an example of using the `@elhedranorg/cdk-static-site` package.

Its currently hard coded to my domain and account id, so you will need to edit
`src/app.ts` with your own configuration prior to deploying.  This is not best
practice, rather developers should use the CDK context however it is sufficient
for the talk this example is associated with.

```bash
npm install
npm run deploy
```
